yesterday summary
1. spring framework... 
1.1 how spring will create objects.
1.2 wiring..


spring project should work.
in terms of practicals..


telescope..

1.we know the architecture
2. we have core java code working....
3. convert this into spring framework code..
4. we add whatever things are needed.. database, securuity, web services.
5. once 4 is working then figure out how to move it to the cloud.

object being created
wiring is done
two senteneces meaning we should know..


dependency injection  -- we are givng one object of one class,in some function of
the other class.
two kind of dependany injection exists
1. setter injection
2. constructor injection.

inversion of control
instead of we creating objects, spring will create objects.

a mechanism for doing dependency injection and inversion of control
-- IOC container..

basic thing in spring framework.

1. do you know architecture.
2. did spring create objects which you asked it to create.
3. was the wiring done.
4. did you get the object from spring.
5. in this adventure be conscious about which object is created by spring

annotations..
user of annotation.

1. I use annotation given by X.
2. i know the benefit and on what the annotation should be used.
3. i also when the benefit comes.
4. my code will interact with code of X... 

example
1. i  am using @component given by spring framework
2. i know @component tells spring hey create the object of the class.
@component should be used at class level.. open documentation.
3. spring framework should process my class only the benefit will come.
4. 


we will keep getting lot of doubts while coding.. uncertainty will be there
are we willing to write a small program to clarify our doubt on
concept or syntax is the question.. this skill will help us a lot in a project.


@componentScan
@component
@Autowired

while using annotations what we should remember is. you should
own the code to use the annotation..

this error is coming because I was unconscious in terms of
which objects spring should have to complete my code..

when we are busy in java, hardest question do we know which part
of the project will change, which part of the project will not change
that will give us data how to use interfaces..

x+ spring = x becomes easier... ok that is template design pattern at work..
event handling== observer design pattern at work..


spring can create objects and wire it..
we should know what is meaning of it when done thru xml and also thru annotations.

when a doubt comes java guys should create a package..

experience may give syntax, but concept is not a function of time..

we should not care for the order in which object is getting created.
only care whether the objects were created and wired properly
we should be conscious which object spring has got..
in our current case we know.

1. Presentation
2. Service object
3. Dao object is also there with spring..

i know architecture means we can test any layer indendently becusae
that is meaning of architecture.

why we could these things..
we were conscious which objects are there with spring framework *******
very important for any programmer who works on spring.



1. 
first see whether this programs are working in your system
archcode example...how to do with xml how to do with annotations.
home loan application, calculator ( xml version , annotation version of it)
