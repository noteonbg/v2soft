looking at spring code.. and spring boot code...

tell me about spring.
1. java based framework to be used in service layer(business layer) and dao layer)
2. tell me where we will not use today... presentation layer... can I use spring
in presentation layer yes.. but we will not use it, because java is no longer
the boss of presentation layer per say...( mobileapp, web app, desktop.. QT...)

advantage of spring.
1. loose coupling..
2. x+spring = x becomes easier
3. aspect oriented programming.

spring boot.. is not  replacement of spring, it is a cover on spring..
spring boot makes spring easier to use.. how...
if we spend x time on configuring in spring.
in spring boot it is y time you be sure y < x;

Annotation. who are we .. user or creator, in doubt. ok we are user..

1.what is benefit you get.. 
2. when you will get the benefit
3. on what you have to use annotation.. ie class, variable or the method how will i know
open documentation..
4. ok. if you think annotation is an application of reflection.

intent first language next.. national anthem...

what is our intent..
to solve customer problems(X) or improve our technical skills at customer's cost.(Y)
ok what it does it mean technically?

prefer higher level of abstraction... 

ghosts should come to earth...
any intent should be backed with lot of action with details..


we should be fan of any rule but when we violate rules we should be able to give
reason why we violated the rule..

I want to remember less. that means generalize.. that means learn design patterns
that is part of generalizing..


spring coding
1. architecture spring cannot decide we decide.
2. where you want loose coupling and wehere you want tight coupling we decide..
3. ask spring to create objects, wire it and get the object from spring..


I am using spring framework.. means
1. i must be using the spring related classes, interfaces and annotations 

maven as a build tool

build tool.( java based world maven, graddle--zero value add from customer perspective
developer perspective)
1. assemble the code.
2. compile the code.
3. package the code.
4. deploy the code
5. run the code..
1 to 5 are monotonous things.. repetitive things so better let the tool do the job..

steps in coding spring framework...
0. decide the architecture
1. create the classes and interfaces.
2. which one to wire where... (put one thing inside other)
3. decide which object will be created by spring which object will be created by us...
and remember it
4. tell spring hey create the object and wire it ( xml or annotations(preferred )
5. ask spring to process this annotation or xml.
6. sprng would have object with it.
7. ask spring hey give me the object.. ( ends the sprng code then what we do is our logic)

logging in constructors..
if a  line in constructor gets logged, that means object of the class has been created

which libraries to include int he project.
requires patience...

it depends on what are we doing..
here I am interested in just hello world spring... == create object wire it.

if we have  class called A
if we have class called B
inside B there is a function f1, 

class B
{
public void f1(A temp)
{

}


}

to f1 function of B, we need object of B and object of A also.


when you see a new class, bp issue should not come , because if we open
documentation it will tell us.. what it will do..
nobody is asking us to do astrology on a classname which is from a library...

scary ghost world in computer science "it is inbuilt"
since we  are mentioning the file name.. file name can be anything.. carrot.xml
beans.xml

create object of presentation
create object of business layer
creat object of dao
wire dao in business layer
wire business layer in presentation.

create object of model
create object of view.
wire model inside view.

create database connection object.
create dao object.
wire connection object in dao.

during spring framework, know core java is most important thing..

day 1 story a programmer who is not good at variables and functions should
not be a programmer.





two common jargons used in spring..
1. dependency injection
2. inversion of control.
